# Ability practice — development foundation

This module is under development on `codex/ability-practice`. It implements the deterministic
practice policy, explicit catalog model and bounded original-action accounting. There is no loader, player hook, database
migration, installed addon, runtime configuration or production activation in this checkpoint.

`src/AbilityPracticeProgression.h` provides configurable training bands, progression after a qualifying action,
exact action forecasts across catch-up/rate changes, cap handling and separate character-level/practice eligibility.
Definitions contain no final balance constants: proficiency caps and policy bands are supplied by the caller.

Each band starts at a proficiency and defines points required per proficiency point and points awarded per qualifying
use. Changes take effect at that boundary. An action earns points using its starting band's rate; carried points
continue through later bands. Reaching the current cap discards newly excess points. An already trained value above
a temporarily reduced cap is preserved and cannot earn additional practice. Corrupt policy/state inputs are rejected.
Forecasts report complete, trainable, beyond current cap or invalid; beyond-cap is never represented as a trainable
zero-use result. Large intervals are calculated by bands rather than simulated cast by cast.

The function name `ApplyQualifyingUse` requires its future caller to establish eligibility and deduplicate the
original action. This header does not claim to identify casts, effective healing or anti-grind rules. Event policy,
live cast attribution, persistence, acquisition enforcement, migration and versioned addon snapshots remain future stages.

`src/AbilityPracticeCatalog.h` defines class-scoped stable ability identities, explicit rank requirements, ranked/mastery/
fixed kinds, and level-cap schedules. Validation rejects duplicate ability/spell ownership, malformed ranks and caps.
`DescribeRank` returns learned, acquire introductory ability, prerequisite, practice, level and ready states alongside
an exact forecast where current caps allow one. Introductory abilities always retain their normal acquisition route.
`SeedLearnedRanks` raises proficiency to support already learned ranks without reducing stronger existing progress;
the persistence layer must apply that migration once, rather than reseeding on every login. Fixtures use synthetic IDs,
not approved production class mappings. The effective all-class inventory remains outstanding.

`src/AbilityPracticeActions.h` tracks a bounded number of original actions per player session using opaque tokens.
One qualifying outcome consumes an action once; subsequent targets, outcomes and ticks cannot award it again.
Unqualified outcomes leave it eligible for a later qualifying outcome. Closed actions and prior-session tokens are
rejected, and a full ledger refuses new actions rather than evicting an action that could earn twice. Runtime integration
must assign unique session IDs, identify original actions, close their complete outcome lifetime, exclude triggered/
passive actions where appropriate, and establish meaningful-use qualification. No current player hook provides all
of that attribution by itself. Neither API stores live player pointers or performs database writes.

The future menu will distinguish character level, learned rank and trained proficiency, with exact qualifying uses
to the next point/milestone. No random fizzles, magic-school categories or automatic upgrades on unrelated abilities
are part of the accepted design. Existing learned abilities must survive migration. Unranked rewards and numerical
training profiles still need balance review.

Verification runs through `python -B tools/verify_all.py --stages source,harness --base 36117f3e9
--harness ability_practice --jobs 1`. This focused harness compiles the actual header and exercises forecast/award
agreement, changing bands, over-cap retention, malformed inputs, large counts, catalog/acquisition states, migration
seeding and action deduplication/session isolation. It neither
builds a worldserver nor accesses any server/database. Full build and gameplay qualification remain required before
integration or deployment. Keep all development in this checkout while the user plays.
