-- CoA Custom 1.4: the added races start in the starting zone that fits them, spread over the six classic ones
-- (until now every Alliance one started in Northshire and every Horde one in the Valley of Trials).
-- Each race takes the start of a template race, class by class; the Death Knight start (map 609) is not touched.
-- Only new characters are affected.
