# CoA Custom 1.2: custom races, vanilla classes, more incarnations

An add-on for the **Jealous-Sound CoA repack of 30 September updated to CoA Bots 1.8** (release
`main-20261004-b5f1c026`). It installs on top of them the same way CoA Bots does.

Still on CoA Bots 1.6? Run the CoA Bots 1.8 update first (`CoA-Update-1.8\Update-1.8.bat`), or keep using CoA Custom
1.1, which stays available for the 30 September repack with CoA Bots 1.6.

## What's new in 1.2

- **Built on CoA Bots 1.8**: Jealous-Sound's core of 4 October with SquidBots' 14 commits, and the 1.8 bot module.
- **Bots play the custom races.** New random bots are created in every playable race, Murlocs, Worgen and Vulpera
  included, and only in the CoA classes (CoA Bots' `AiPlayerbot.CoaClassesOnly`).
  - Custom-race bots now fight for the right faction: the bot code only knew the 5 old Alliance races, so a
    Worgen, Vrykul or Alliance Murloc bot counted as Horde.
  - Bots of the male-only races (Tuskarr, Taunka, Vrykul, Broken, Fel Orc, Forest Troll, Ice Troll, Skeleton) are
    always male. Female ones had no body: invisible, or with a broken face. The installer switches existing ones
    to male.
- **Other players' Murlocs are no longer white.** The server re-sent every model numbered 652000 and up to the client
  with empty textures, because it had no copy of the client's model table to compare against. The package now
  installs that copy (`Data\dbc_clientset\CreatureDisplayInfo.dbc`).
- **No more "Spellbook.Enable" warnings.** The bot server lacked the Book of Ascension settings file, and logged a
  warning on every Book lookup.
- The world database changes are rebuilt for the 1.8 database, so they don't undo any of its newer updates.

**Upcoming in 1.3: an auction house bot** that fills the auction house with items.

Updating from 1.1: run the CoA Bots 1.8 update, then extract the 1.2 zip over your `CoA-Custom` folder and run
`Install-Custom.bat`. 1.2 keeps its backup in `CoA-Custom\backup-b5f1c026\`. Original data files and the client patch
come from your 1.1 backup, so `Uninstall-Custom.bat` still puts back the true originals.

## What was new in 1.1

- **Earthen textures fixed.**
  - Male: the face was a squashed patch. He now uses the Dwarf HD textures his own were copied from.
  - Female: her model was the old pre-HD Dwarf female, which the HD textures don't fit. She now uses the HD Dwarf
    female model, with its faces and hair.
- **The installer backs up your accounts and characters first** (also when uninstalling), into
  `CoA-Custom\character-backups\`. It never deletes these backups.

## What it adds

- **21 extra playable races** on both factions:
  - Goblin, Zandalari Troll, Worgen, High Elf, Tuskarr, Kul Tiran, Taunka, Vrykul, Vulpera.
  - Pandaren (Alliance and Horde), Naga, Broken, Fel Orc, Forest Troll, Ice Troll, Skeleton, Earthen, Drakkari Troll.
  - Murloc (Alliance and Horde): an armored Whim murloc as "male", a classic murloc as "female". Several skin
    colours, and an Armor option from none to four armor sets.
- **Every race can play every class**, CoA and classic.
- **Racials**: each new race uses the racials of a base race, plus one bonus racial borrowed from another race. The
  creation screen shows the bonus racial when you hover the race.
- **Classic (vanilla) classes next to the CoA classes**:
  - Real WotLK spells and talents, using Bronzebeard's level-60 tuning.
  - The spells of level 1 on creation; everything else is bought in the Book of Ascension at the normal price.
  - The classic talent window works.
- **Wardrobe incarnations**:
  - The classic classes' forms and pets.
  - Several CoA forms now wear druid, shaman or warlock incarnations. Bloodmage: Eternal Curse → Cat, Accursed
    Form → Metamorphosis. Reaper: Underwalk → Ghost Wolf, Ghost Form → Travel Form. Starcaller: forms → Moonkin.
  - See `INCARNATIONS.md` for the full list.
- **120 characters** per realm and account.

## Before you start

### Prerequisites

1. **The Jealous-Sound CoA repack** (Conquest of Azeroth, by Jealous Sound), started once and working.
2. **CoA Bots 1.9.1** (release `main-20261007-b46a130e`) installed in it, made by the **SquidBots team**:
   - core source: https://github.com/Zyth45/azerothcore-wotlk-coa (branch `coa-bots-1.9.1`)
   - bot module: https://github.com/Zyth45/mod-playerbots
   - companion addon: https://github.com/Zyth45/squidbots-addon

   On CoA Bots 1.8 or 1.9? Run its update (`CoA-Update-1.9.1\Update-1.9.1.bat`) first. This package replaces the
   CoA Bots worldserver, so CoA Bots must be installed even if you don't want bots (see below).
3. **The Ascension game client**: the package installs its own client files there.

**Bots:** the installer asks how many random bots you want: `100`, `200`, `500` (**recommended**, the default),
`1000`, `2000` (the CoA Bots default) or `off` (no bots; the Auction House merchant still works). More bots need more
RAM, and a busy town with many different races can run the 32-bit game client out of memory. Run the installer again
any time to change your choice.

It then asks which races the bots use:
1. **Bots Vanilla race (recommended)**: the original races only, stable.
2. **Bots Custom race (Experimental, can cause crashes: use only if you want to help find bugs)**: the added races
   too. If it crashes, send us the crash logs from your game's `Errors` folder.

Existing bots keep their race; `CoA-Bots\Purge-Bots.bat` recreates them all with the new choice.

**Back up first** (the installer also backs up your accounts and characters, but a full copy is safest):
1. Stop the server with `Stop_All_Server.bat`.
2. Copy your repack folder somewhere safe.
3. Copy `Data\patch-T.MPQ` from your game folder (if you have one).

## Install

1. Close the game. Stop the server (`Stop_All_Server.bat`).
2. Extract the zip **inside your repack folder**. You get `<repack>\CoA-Custom\`, next to `Start_All_Server.bat`.
3. Run `CoA-Custom\Install-Custom.bat`. It:
   - checks your repack and CoA Bots versions;
   - asks for your Ascension game folder (the one with `Ascension.exe`);
   - backs up your accounts and characters into `CoA-Custom\character-backups\`;
   - backs up everything it will replace into `CoA-Custom\backup-b5f1c026\`. That's `worldserver.exe`, 15 server DBC
     files, `patch-T.MPQ`, two settings templates and the 109 world tables it changes;
   - copies the files: the server, data, client patch, the server's copy of the client model table and the Book
     settings for the bot server;
   - applies `files\sql\1_world.sql` and `2_bots.sql`, then starts the server with CoA Bots.
4. Start the game when the worldserver says it is ready.

Want to see what it would do first? Run `Install-Custom.bat --check`; it changes nothing.

After that, start the server with `CoA-Bots\Start_All_Bots.bat`, as with CoA Bots.

## Uninstall

Run `CoA-Custom\Uninstall-Custom.bat`. It puts back the backed-up files and world tables and removes the
`custom_race_display` table.

Characters of the extra races, or race/class pairs only this package allows, can't log in without it.

## Known problems

- The client can crash when you close it (`0x008CFF83`). It started with the extra races; the cause is unknown.
- Tuskarr legs miss a piece: the model has no leg geosets.
- In game the Murloc wears an NPC look, so armor doesn't show on it.
- The Murloc can't preview gear in the Wardrobe.
- Murloc gear is hidden on the character list.
- Right after a start, CoA Bots 1.8 bots log thousands of "Synchronized proficiencies" lines (the bots get Plate or
  Mail again, and the CoA class rules take it away again), and the server can feel slow for a few minutes. It's
  inside CoA Bots 1.8, not this add-on, and it calms down once the bots have logged in.

Found a bug? Open an issue on this repository. Say:
- the race, class and gender;
- what you did, and what you expected;
- a screenshot if it's visual. For crashes, add the newest file from `CoA-Bots\Core\Crashes`.

## Source and rebuilding

- **Server C++**: branch `coa-custom-1.8` of this fork: our commits on top of CoA Bots 1.8's core `b5f1c026`
  (Zyth45/azerothcore-wotlk-coa `coa-bots-1.8`). Build it like the repack's core, together with the bot module from
  [ilusixn/mod-playerbots](https://github.com/ilusixn/mod-playerbots/tree/coa-custom-1.8) branch `coa-custom-1.8`:
  CoA Bots 1.8's module `48c4786a` plus 2 fixes (bot faction and gender for the extra races).
  - CoA Custom 1.0 / 1.1 (CoA Bots 1.6): branch `coa-custom`.
- **Data and client patch**: the scripts in `scripts\` (Python 3 with `mpyq`, `numpy`, `Pillow`). They read the
  Ascension client and the repack's original DBC files and write the DBCs, SQL, models and Lua of `patch-T.MPQ`.
  - Client pipeline:
    `mpqget.py` → `make_player_models.py` → `make_murloc_model.py` → `gen_races.py` → `gen_race_looks.py` →
    `patchlua*.py` → `build.py`.
  - Classic classes: `gen.py`, `gen2.py`, `gen_talents.py`, `gen_outfits.py`, `gen_racial_combos.py`,
    `gen_appearance_categories.py`.
  - The scripts were written for one machine. Paths such as `C:\CoA-Repack` and `C:\Ascension Local` are at the
    top of each file.
- `files\sql\1_world.sql` is generated. It compares a server with every change against the repack's clean database,
  and is checked by applying it to a clean copy and comparing again.

Most of this work was done with an AI coding assistant, then tested in game.

## Auction House bot

After installing, create an account and a character for the merchant (worldserver console: `account create ahbot <password>`,
then log in once and create a character), then put that account id and character guid in
`CoA-Bots\Core\configs\modules\mod_ahbot.conf` (`AuctionHouseBot.Account`, `AuctionHouseBot.GUID`) and set
`AuctionHouseBot.EnableSeller = 1` and `AuctionHouseBot.EnableBuyer = 1`. Restart the servers.
